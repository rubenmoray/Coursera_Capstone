As it's described in the assigment's description, you will find, in the first instance, the problem described followed by a discussion of the background, and the preparation of the data that has been used for the analysis.\n\n\n# Introduction / Businness Understanding\n\n### The city of Oxford is well known around the entire world because of its University, which is considered by a vast amount of people as the best university of the world.

The origin of which will be defined accordingly.\n"
